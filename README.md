# Short-Cuts-for-Deep-Neural-models (2023)

This repository contains code to accompany a Thesis Submitted to EEMCS Faculty Delft University of Technology, 
in Partial Fulfilment of the Requirements for the Bachelor of Computer Science and Engineering.

Notable credits should go to [JoshuaGhost](https://github.com/JoshuaGhost) for creating and maintaining [ExPred: the Deep Neural model](https://github.com/JoshuaGhost/expred) which we have studied for this thesis.
The model is an implementation of the paper [Explain and Predict, and then Predict Again](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3437963.3441758).

### Reproducing the Research

Here are the steps for those who are interested in reproducing the research.

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the requirements for the ``ExPred model`` by ``pip install -r requirements``
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebooks

### Structure

This repository is a copy of the ExPred repository, with added Jupyter Notebooks.
It contains subsequences mined from the FeVer dataset, a big database (90.000 items) of fact queries containing a label 'Supported' or 'Refuted'.
The ExPred model draws evidence from Wikipedia pages to give queries those labels.

For this experiment 3 steps:
